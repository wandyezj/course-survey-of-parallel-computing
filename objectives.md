    * The limits of determinism (operations where order of execution matters (floating point))
* C++ STL parallel library
    * Thread Parallelism
    * Syncronization
* Open MP
* Nvidia CUDA
    * The GPU paradigm
* MPI
    * Super computer paradigm

## Understand the following concepts:

* Assessing Paralle Algorithm Correctness
* Assessing Parallel Algorithm Performance
* Understand the limits of parallelism
* Locality of time and space and their impact on performance
* The difference between Concurrency and Parallelosm


## Uses for Parallel Computing
