# Methodology

project verification for correctness will be automated so that students may easily check their work.

the same verification main can be used for most intro programs that calculate 2 norm as on the function call contents change.

the same interface can be used throughout Bothell for providing input and collecting result output.

for other problems text compare may be used for solutions that have a sequentially correct answer.


since performance output is the same the same measuring script can be used for every project.



## Graphs

Data Points:
* Algorithm / Implementation
* Problem Size
* Cores / Threads
* Time


## Handing in assignments

Everything required for hand in will be placed under a directory labeled report

All question files will be in markdown.

Multiple choice questions will be similarly handed in via markdown.

Where possible, any graphs that the report requires will be autogenerated.

There will be zero dependencies between questions on the homework.
